In this project I'm using React and Redux for manage client side work flow. I'm also using Bootstrap for responsive design.


For server side I'm using Node.js with express framework for manage server side work flow and use MongoDB for storing database.

For online payment I'm using Omise.js aka a platform for merchants. If u would like to use payment function just insert 4242424242424242 for card number and 123 for security code.
